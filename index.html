        <h4>Why I became a web developer</h4>
        <p>Well this is a long story. <br>
          I began my journey with a bachelor degree in cultural science. While I was studying I were fascinated by how to commnunicate to gain trust and attention and so I choose to build (with help from a friend) a website to a choir in Gothenburg. I liked both the programming and communication part so after a short brief in my life I decided to contiune my journey towards communication studies. <br>
          While I were studying communication I took every oppertunity to build websites (again with help from a friend) and started to learn basic programming at my spare time. I also noticed I were more interested in communication on websites then write strategies. <br>
          So, eventually I tried my luck and applied to YRGOs web developer program and I were accepted. It´s been a hard and fun journey. The more I learn, the more I understand that there is so much more to learn. It can be a struggle but it is also fun to actually see my own progress. To look back at a code I wrote months ago and see how to improve it, make it more effective and more readable. <br>
          That is why I continue my journey. To get better, to learn new smarter ways, learn new programming languages and make better and safer websites.
